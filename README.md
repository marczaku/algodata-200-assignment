# Introduction

In this Assignment, You need to set your own goals. They need to be agreed on with your lecturer, though.

Upload a document named `GOALS.md` to specify your goals before working on the project.

## Requirements:

1. Your Application needs to face a Pathfinding Problem of some kind.
2. A Graph Representation of some sort (Grid, Graph, Mesh) needs to be created for the Problem's States by you. Manually creating or defining it counts as creating.
3. A Visual Representation of the current State needs to be created. Text counts as a Visual Representation in a Console Application.
4. Your Application needs to use a Pathfinding Algorithm of your choice to solve the Problem.
5. Your Application needs to show the solution of your Problem. The Path of the solution is important. Not just the Final Step. Consider running it Step by Step (`WaitForSeconds`) or displaying the full Path, if applicable.
6. All above points need to document in your Repository's `README.md`. What is the problem and what Algorithm & Data Structure did you choose, due to what circumstances? Would there have been alternatives?

## Grading:

**Passing**: The student has provided a Pathfinding Problem and was able to visualize and solve it. The documentation demonstrates the decisions that were made for solving the problems in an understandable manner. Alternatively, if the approach failed, but there is a visible attempt at solving a complex problem and the steps are documented understandably, the expectations are fulfilled as well.

**Excellent**: All from before and furthermore: The Problem is special in its complexity and requires a custom-tailored solution. The documentation supports the decision-making and demonstrates the uniqueness of the problem. This does not require the student to reinvent a pathfinding Algorithm, but the Data-Structure or the problem of the game may require a custom approach for creating the Graph.

## Where to start?

### 1. Find a problem that you'd like to solve.

A few characteristics of a problem:

All States Are Visible right away
- Else: You have to Rebuild the Graph as new information is gained.
- Else: You also need to sometimes make moves that don't bring you to the Goal, just to get further. (Bug-Algorithm)

There is no opponent that can do unexpected Moves (Easy)
- Else: Your algorithm has to avoid running into traps.

There is always a solution
- Else: Your algorithm has to handle unsolvable problems.

### 2. Develop a Data Model for the Start-State

- What defines any state of your problem?
- What does your exact state look like?

e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe: 9 empty cells

### 3. Create a View for The Data Model

Visualize the Game State on the Screen.

e.g. Console ASCII Output

### 4. Develop a Data Model for the Target-State

Sometimes, there's exactly one Target State, sometimes, there's various possible Target States in this case, you don't do `if(state == target_state)`, but rather `if(is_target_state(state))` where you for example check Win Conditions.

e.g. in Tic-Tac-Toe, each state with a filled row or column or diagonal is a Target-State

### 5. Develop a Data Model for the State Transitions and Adjacent States

- What Moves are possible? Do they come at costs or risks?
- You don't need to create a full Grid on Start. But you need to have rules that tell you, what other States are reachable from one State to another.

e.g. in Tic-Tac-Toe many moves are possible, but not all (e.g. if Player has lost, the game is over)

### 6. Choose a Pathfinding Algorithm

Choose the best fitting algorithm and run it. Receive a Path.

e.g. MinMax-Algorithm

### 7. Execute the Path

Execute the Path with all its connections step by step on the View.

e.g. Show each turn one by one with a one second delay.

### 8. Replace this README with your own Documentation

As specificed in the Requirements.

## Bonus (Advanced):

- Can you create Random Start States or Target States for the Problem?
- Can you make sure that your generated States are solvable?
- Can you make it Playable with a "Solve From Here"-Button?
- Maybe you can make a "Suggest Next Move"-Button?
